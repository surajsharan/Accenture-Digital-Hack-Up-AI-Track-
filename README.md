## Problem Statement
Ponder is a platform for sharing your thoughts, or promoting some personal stuff and everything. Not only that it is also a very good place to check to keep yourself with what is happening around the world. But it has a very strict posting policy, and getting credits for good comments are really. Youâ€™re someone who has just started to use Ponder as a new user, you want to predict whether your comment is going to receive a good score or not.

Given a dataset of past comments and their scores (training dataset), you have to build a model that can predict scores of comments present in the test dataset.

## Data Description
The dataset has the following columns :

| *Column Label*        |  *Column Description*                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UID**               |   Unique Id                                               |
| **comment**           |   Reply to a parent comment                               |
| **date**              |   Comment data                                            |
| **parent_commnet**    |   The parent comment to which sarcastic comments are made |
| **score**             |   Score on the parent_commen                              |
